For this exercise we’d like you to build a very simple blog. You are allowed do this either of the

following ways:

1. Write your own MVC web app using ruby on rails

2. Build a javascript MVC front end app paired with either your own backend api (bonus

points ­ but it’s always been better for our candidates to go with the system you know

better rather than try for the bonus points)

Once you’ve built the blog we’ll do a live coding session to add features to the blog.

Blog Requirements

● The index page for the blog shows all the blog posts created by any user sorted by the

post’s creation date

● We’ll need a mechanism to create users and allow them to sign in

● Any authenticated user should be allowed to create a blog post

○ we don’t have a specific design in mind but each post should show the

associated title, body, date, and the name or email of the post’s author

○ we aren’t judging on the type of authentication system, just so long as it provides

distinction between authenticated and unauthenticated users

○ the post has a title

○ the post has body text

○ the post should be stored the date at which it was created

○ the post should be associated with the author

● Commit your code up to a github repository that we provide. You should have an invite to

the repository at https://github.com/orgs/PracticallyGreen/invitation?via_email=1

Some things to keep in mind

● Don't worry about the front end design and ui: ugly but functional is my motto... don't

read into that.

● If you are writing a back end then pick a dynamic language (prefer Ruby, Python, or

Javascript) with which you are most comfortable.

● Set up a server to which you can deploy code rapidly. We expect this will be a local

server, but can be deployed remotely if you are more comfortable/faster with that.

● Use a database system with which you are comfortable. Most frameworks usually

provide an ORM to simplify this as well.

● Feel free to harvest code from an old project for the basis of the MVC app ­ it doesn’t

need to be all from scratch as it is just a starting point.

● We are looking to gauge your comfort with your preferred tools in web development.

● Writing good automated tests as part of the development process can really show your

expertise.

● Speed is not as important as clarity of explanation and thought.

● We will be providing feedback and guidance while you are writing the app.
